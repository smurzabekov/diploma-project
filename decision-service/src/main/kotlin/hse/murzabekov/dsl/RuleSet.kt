/**
 * This class represents a set of rules in a group. They must be working with a same instance of T. All actions
 * will be executed if rules' conditions are true. This is good use case for request validation. You might have
 * a set of validation rules and return all the validation error when executing the entire set of rules. Another
 * use case might be response filter for a service in the fine-grained authorization. Each rule will apply a filter
 * on either a column or a row depending on if the conditions are met.
